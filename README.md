# Termite_2.0
Decentralized Network & Blockchain
This project implements a decentralized peer-to-peer network with a custom blockchain backend and a full-featured API for interacting with it. The system allows nodes to communicate, validate transactions, and maintain a distributed ledger in a trustless environment.
Features
Peer-to-Peer Network: Nodes can join and discover peers without central servers.
Custom Blockchain: Supports transaction validation, block creation, and consensus mechanisms.
RESTful API: Provides endpoints for submitting transactions, querying balances, and fetching blockchain data.
Security & Integrity: Ensures data immutability and integrity through cryptographic hashing.
Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle multiple nodes efficiently with minimal central coordination.
